Note: If installing libPNG for the first time, please do not install the latest version (1.6) - some functionality required by SimpleImage has been deprecated. 
Instead, install version 1.5* or earlier. 

============ Windows ============================================================

Please use the provided Visual Studio project file (found in /vs2012). This should include all
necessary libraries (libPNG) to build the starter version of raster2d (as shown on page 1 of the
assignment.)

Users of VS2008/2010.., please follow these instructions for linking your own VS solution:
- make a new project containing the starter files 
- right-click the project, go to Properties -> VC++ Directories
- in Include Directories, add the (relative!) paths to libpng and zlib
    e.g. for the included vs2012 project, we have ../ext/libpng/include;../ext/zlib/include
- in Library Directories, add the path to the .lib files, e.g., ../ext/win/lib/$(Configuration)
- in Properties -> Linker -> Input, add the library names, libpng.lib;zlib.lib
- Repeat for Debug/Release configurations

(If you have trouble converting the provided starter files to earlier versions of VS, please 
contact the course staff.)

Cygwin users: you should be able to use the provided Makefile. If libpng was not installed by
default, you will need to install the libpng-devel package separately. You may consider
installing via a package installer like apt-cyg (https://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg/) 


============ OSX ============================================================

Please use the provided Makefile. libpng should be included with your developer tools;
but if libPNG is not found for some reason, you can compile from source (see below) or use 
a package manager like Fink:

    http://www.finkproject.org/

i.e.,
    fink install libpng15 libpng15-shlibs

(You will need to uncomment the relevant lines in the Makefile).
Other package managers like Homebrew and MacPorts also offer easy libpng installs.


============ Linux/Unix ============================================================

Please use the provided Makefile. (Most linux distros ship with libpng already installed.)

If libPNG is not found, it is easily installed using a package installer like apt-get
on Ubuntu:

     sudo apt-get install libpng-dev

Or, it can be compiled from source directly. Go to:

    http://libpng.sourceforge.net/

And download libpng-1.2.51.tar.gz 
(Although this is not the latest version, it is known to work with SimpleImage.)

Decompress the tarball into its own directory:

    tar zxvf libpng-<version>.tar.gz

Navigate to that directory:

    cd libpng-<...>

Configure, and tell it where to install. For instance, to install to /usr/local, you
would type:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Then make and install:
    make
    sudo make install

Then, return to this directory (your hw3 starter code directory), make, and check to
see that running the program produces the test image as described in the assignment.
